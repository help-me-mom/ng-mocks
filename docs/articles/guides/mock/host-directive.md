title: How to mock a host directive

It can happen that a component hast a host directive which should be mocked in a test.

There are several ways how `ng-mocks` can mock host directives:

- [`MockBuilder`](../../api/MockBuilder.md#shallow-flag) and its [`shallow`](../../api/MockBuilder.md#shallow-flag) flag
- [`MockBuilder`](../../api/MockBuilder.md) constructor
- `TestBed`

## `shallow` flag

It's the easiest and recommended way which covers all host directives automatically, so there is no need to specify all of them.

To mock all host directives, simply provide [`shallow`](../../api/MockBuilder.md#shallow-flag) flag in [`MockBuilder.mock`](../../api/MockBuilder.md#mock):

```ts
beforeEach(() =>
  MockBuilder().mock(TargetComponent, { shallow: true }),
);
```

Now, all host directives and their dependencies will be mocks.

## `MockBuilder`

[`MockBuilder`](../../api/MockBuilder.md) is useful, when only one or some host directives should be mocked.

To do so, the host directives should be specified as the second parameter of [`MockBuilder`](../../api/MockBuilder.md):

```ts
beforeEach(() => MockBuilder(TargetComponent, HostDirective));
```

That's it, now `TargetComponent` will have a mock of `HostDirective`.

## TestBed

If you use `TestBed`, you should mock the desired host directive with [`MockDirective`](../../api/MockDirective.md)
and import / declare its component.

For example, if the name of the component is `TargetComponent` and its host directive is called `HostDirective`,
then `TestBed` can be defined like that:

```ts
beforeEach(() =>
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    imports: [MockDirective(HostDirective)], // mocking the host directive
    declarations: [TargetComponent], // declaring the component under test
  }).compileComponents(),
);
```

Profit! Under the hood `TargetComponent` will be redefined to use a mock of `HostDirective`.
