Testing a route means that we want to assert that a specific page renders a specific component.

With `ng-mocks` you can be confident, that a route exists and all its dependencies are present in the imported module,
otherwise tests will fail.

However, to test that, we need to configure `TestBed` a bit differently:

- it is fine to mock all components and declarations
- `RouterModule` should be kept as it is, so it can do its job
- `RouterTestingModule` should be added with empty routes
- [`NG_MOCKS_ROOT_PROVIDERS`](/api/MockBuilder.md#ng_mocks_root_providers-token) should be kept, 
  because `RouterModule` depends on many root services which cannot be mocked.

This guarantees that the application's routes will be used,
and tests fail if a route or its dependencies have been removed.

```ts
beforeEach(() =>
  MockBuilder(
    // Things to keep and export.
    [
      RouterModule,
      RouterTestingModule.withRoutes([]),
      NG_MOCKS_ROOT_PROVIDERS,
    ], 
    // Things to mock.
    TargetModule,
  )
);
```

The next and very important step is to wrap a test callback in `it` with `fakeAsync` function and to render `RouterOutlet`.
We need this, because `RouterModule` relies on async zones.
Also, please note an empty object as the second parameter, it's needed to leave inputs of `RouterOutlet` untouched.

```ts
// fakeAsync --------------------------|||||||||
it('renders /1 with Target1Component', fakeAsync(() => {
  const fixture = MockRender(RouterOutlet, {});
}));
```

After we have rendered `RouterOutlet` we should initialize the router, also we can set the default url here.
As mentioned above, we should use zones and `fakeAsync` for that.

```ts
const router = TestBed.get(Router);
const location = TestBed.get(Location);

location.go('/1');
if (fixture.ngZone) {
  fixture.ngZone.run(() => router.initialNavigation());
  tick();
}
```

Now we can assert the current route and what it has rendered.

```ts
expect(location.path()).toEqual('/1');
expect(() => ngMocks.find(fixture, Target1Component)).not.toThrow();
```

That is it.

Additionally, we might assert that a link on a page navigates to the right route.
In this case, we should pass the component with the link as the first parameter to [`MockBuilder`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-mocks#mockbuilder),
and to render the component instead of `RouterOutlet`.

```ts
beforeEach(() =>
  MockBuilder(
    // Things to keep and export.
    [
      TargetComponent,
      RouterModule,
      RouterTestingModule.withRoutes([]),
      NG_MOCKS_ROOT_PROVIDERS,
    ], 
    // Things to mock.
    TargetModule,
  )
);
```

```ts
it('navigates between pages', fakeAsync(() => {
  const fixture = MockRender(TargetComponent);
}));
```

The next step is to find the link we want to click. The click event should be inside of zones, because it triggers navigation.
Please notice, that `button: 0` should be sent with the event to simulate the left button click.

```ts
const links = ngMocks.findAll(fixture, 'a');
if (fixture.ngZone) {
  fixture.ngZone.run(() => {
    links[0].triggerEventHandler('click', {
      button: 0, // <- simulating the left button click, not right one.
    });
  });
  tick();
}
```

Now we can assert the current state: the location should be changed to the expected route, and the fixture should contain
its component.

```ts
expect(location.path()).toEqual('/1');
expect(() => ngMocks.find(fixture, Target1Component)).not.toThrow();
```
