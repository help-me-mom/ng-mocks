If you did not read ["How to test a route"](route.md), please do it first.

When you want to test a resolver, you need to remove all other resolves and guards to avoid side effects,
to mock declarations to test the resolver in isolation,
and to keep `RouterModule` and its dependencies to assert results on `Location` and `ActivatedRoute`.

## Functional resolvers

A functional resolver is a simple function which uses `inject` to get another services and to fetch data for its route.
It's important to note that a functional resolver isn't defined as a service or a token,
and, therefore, it exists only in the definition of a route.   

Let's assume, the resolver is called `dataResolver` and the module with its route `TargetModule`.

To configure `TestBed` as described above, the code can be next:

```ts
beforeEach(() =>
  MockBuilder(
    // first parameter
    // providing RouterModule and its dependencies
    [
      RouterModule,
      RouterTestingModule.withRoutes([]),
      NG_MOCKS_ROOT_PROVIDERS,
    ],
  
    // second parameter
    // Mocking definition of TargetModule
    TargetModule,
  )

  // chain
  // excluding all guards to avoid side effects
  .exclude(NG_MOCKS_GUARDS)

  // chain
  // excluding all resolvers to avoid side effects
  .exclude(NG_MOCKS_RESOLVERS)

  // chain
  // keeping dataResolver for testing
  .keep(dataResolver)
);
```

To test the resolver we need to render `RouterOutlet`.

```ts
const fixture = MockRender(RouterOutlet, {}); // {} is required to leave inputs untouched.
```

Additionally, we also need to properly customize mocked services if the resolver is using them to fetch data.

```ts
const dataService = ngMocks.get(DataService);
dataService.data = () => from([false]);
```

The next step is to go to the route where the resolver is, and to trigger initialization of the router.

```ts
const location = ngMocks.get(Location);
const router = ngMocks.get(Router);

location.go('/target');
if (fixture.ngZone) {
  fixture.ngZone.run(() => router.initialNavigation());
  tick();
}
```

Because data is provided to a particular route, we need to find its component in the `fixture` and
to extract `ActivatedRoute` from its injector.
Let's pretend that `/target` renders `TargetComponent`.

```ts
const el = ngMocks.find(fixture, TargetComponent);
const route = ngMocks.get(el, ActivatedRoute);
```

Profit, now we can assert the data the resolver has provided.

```ts
expect(route.snapshot.data).toEqual({
  data: {
    flag: false,
  },
});
```

## Class Resolver (legacy)

If your code has resolvers which a classes and angular services,
the process is exactly the same as for [functional resolvers](#functional-resolvers).

For example, if the class of the resolver is called `DataResolver`,
the configuration of `TestBed` should be the next:

```ts
beforeEach(() =>
  MockBuilder(
    // first parameter
    // providing RouterModule and its dependencies
    [
      RouterModule,
      RouterTestingModule.withRoutes([]),
      NG_MOCKS_ROOT_PROVIDERS,
    ],
  
    // second parameter
    // Mocking definition of TargetModule
    TargetModule,
  )

  // chain
  // excluding all guards to avoid side effects
  .exclude(NG_MOCKS_GUARDS)

  // chain
  // excluding all resolvers to avoid side effects
  .exclude(NG_MOCKS_RESOLVERS)

  // chain
  // keeping DataResolver for testing
  .keep(DataResolver)
);
```

Profit.
